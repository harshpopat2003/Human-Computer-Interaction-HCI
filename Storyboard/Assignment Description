Create a storyboard - Develop a key sequence from your scenarios into a visual story

Include a cover sheet with the following: 
(team name, team members, project title, problem statement)


FOCUS:
Shaping a user journey.
On the person, the context, their needs, and their interaction with the technology. 
What do they get from the technology, what do they provide to the technology.
---
First,
Describe the interaction context and interface type your system will support
Briefly explain how integrating these into your design will help your target users achieve their goals

Second,
Design a detailed storyboard for your team's design idea. Select a key sequence from your scenarios and develop these further.

Your storyboard should include:
• scenes in sequential order
• transitions between screens (how will the user move from one activity to the next)
• clear indication of what each scene represents (what is the context)
• a brief (1 or two lines) script that describes what users are saying, feeling or thinking in each storyboard box



NOTE:
Annotate the story so that we can understand the user context, their thoughts, feelings and interactions with the technology
