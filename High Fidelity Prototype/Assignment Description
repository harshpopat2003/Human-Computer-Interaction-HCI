It should be a clickable prototype that allows us to click-through the screens to examine the content and interaction elements of your technology.

  1. Based upon your GROUP medium fidelity digital wireframes
  2. Create realistic design elements of how people will interact with your technology
  - include working interaction (link to different screens) 
  - create a ’clickable’ prototype
