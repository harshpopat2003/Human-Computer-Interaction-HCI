1. Create digital wireframes based upon the revised low-fi sketch GROUP UI prototype.

Include:
a) Each wireframe MUST be on a single page, ONE page per wireframe (do not put multiple small wireframes on a single page)
b) After the cover sheet, include a page describing the scenario steps your wireframes are supporting 
e.g. 
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. etc
c) Display concrete content related to your domain, not general or abstract placeholder text.
d) Broad Breadth - represent all (or most) intended functionality. This is navigation LABELS, content AREAS
e) Shallow Depth - specific TASK SEQUENCE actions that respond as though the user had provided real input. This is one scenario WORKFLOW that demonstrates how a user would complete a task to achieve their goals
f) Homepage (LANDING page)
g) ANNOTATE each wireframe to highlight the relevant features of each screen
h) DEMONSTRATE how it provides a solution to your Problem Statement.


NOTE:
Build upon previous work,
